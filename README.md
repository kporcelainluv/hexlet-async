# Hexlet Asynchronous programming course in JS

My motivation to take the course was to get a deeper understanding of how asynchronous funcs work & getting more coding practice.

The course is devoted to the asynchronous programming model in JavaScript and the browser event model.
Topics covered include event loops, timers, callbacks, early binding, and error handling.
